    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I was born and raised in <strong>Boston, Massachusetts.</strong> In 2013, I moved to the west coast with my future wife. We first settled in <strong>Seattle</strong>, but felt immediately drawn to <strong>Portland</strong> after our first visit. I moved to the west coast to become a chef, and spent the last decade honing my skills. When the pandemic hit, I reevaluated my priorities and my wife and I started a family. Now I'm excited to begin a new career as a web developer. I plan to take the energy and work ethic I learned in the kitchen, and apply it to my new venture!</p>
